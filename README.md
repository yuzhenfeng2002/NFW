# Newton meets Frank and Wolfe for traffic assignment problem
 
This repository contains the implementation of an algorithm designed to solve the user equilibrium problem. The core idea is to replace the linear subproblem in the Frank-Wolfe method with the minimization of a second-order Taylor approximation of the Beckmann objective. For more details, refer to the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LySGpDVZgCCA5ApK9HvnHy9rOUMoK_Ex/view?usp=sharing).

The project is implemented in C++ and uses CMake for build configuration. It requires a C++17-compliant compiler and the Boost library.

This project is released for academic use only.
